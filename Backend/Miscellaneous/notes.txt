GET & POST Request :

GET :
- Used to GET some response 
- Data sent in query strings
- Limited data sent, String data & visible in URL


POST :
- Used to POST something ( for create/ write / update)
- Data sent via request body (any type of data)


// Handling Get Request

example :

app.get("/register", (req, res) => {
  let { username, password } = req.query;
  res.send(`Welcome to the page ${username}`);
});


// Handling Post Request

- set up POST request route to get some response
- use req.body to get the data sent in the request body
- parse POST request data


app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true}));
app.use(express.json()); // to support JSON-encoded bodies




Object oriented programming :
- To structure our code

- prototypes    
- new operators
- constructor functions
- classes
- keywords (extend,super)
- inheritance
- encapsulation
- polymorphism
- abstraction



Object Prototypes :

- Prototypes are the mechanism by which javascript objects inherit features from one another.
- Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is an object that is used as a template for creating new objects.

- It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their copy.


arr.__proto__ (reference)
arr.prototype  (actial object)
string.prototype (for string proto)

- Every objects in JS has buit-in propertie, which is called ite prototype.
- the prototype is itself object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called prototype chain.
- The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.



Factory Functions :
- A function that create objects.
- Factory functions are a type of function that returns an object.



New Operator :
- The new operator lets developer create an instance of a user-define object type or one of the built-in object type that has a constructor function.


Constructor : 
- it's special function.
- it doesn't return anything.
- start with capital letter basically.



Classes :
- classes are a template for creating objects.

- The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.


Inheritance :

- Inheritance is a mechanism that allow us to create new classes on the basis od already existing classes.


super keyword :
- The super keyword is used to call methods of a parent class from a child class.
- It is used to call the constructor of the parent class from the child class.
