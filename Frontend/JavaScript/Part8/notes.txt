Array Metods :-
-this method take callback as an input. so it is higher order functions.
-It is used to perform some operation on each element of an array.


forEach :
- this method is used to execute a provided function once for each array element.

  arr.forEach(some func defination or name)


Map :
- this method is used to create a new array with the results of applying the provided function on every element in this array.
- it returns a new array with the results of applying the provided function on every element in this array.

let newArr = arr.map(some func)


Filter :
- this method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- it returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

let newArr = arr.filter(some func)


Every :
- this method is used to test whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- it returns true if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- it returns false if at least one element in the array fails the test implemented by the provided function
- it returns false if the array is empty.

- same as logical AND

arr.every(some func)


Some :
- this method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.
- it returns true if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function
- it returns false if no elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function
- it returns false if the array is empty.

- same as logical OR

arr.some(some func)



Reduce :
- this method is used to apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
- it returns the accumulated value.

arr.reduce( reducer func with 2 variable for (accumulator, element));



Default Parameters :
-Giving a default value to the arguments.
-If the argument is not provided, it will use the default value.
-If the argument is provided, it will use the provided value.


function func (a,b=2){
  //do something
}


Spread :
- Expands an iterable into multiple values
- it is used to expand an array into a function call or into the new array constructor.
- it is used to pass a array as arguments to a function.

function func(...arr){
  //do something
}


Rest :
-Allow a function to take an indefinite number of arguments and bundle them in an array.
- It is used to get the rest of the arguments in an array.
- It is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

function func(a,b,...rest){
  //do something
  }


Destructuring :
- Storing values of array into multiple variables.
- It is used to unpack values from an array or an object into distinct variables.
