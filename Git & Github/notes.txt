Untracked :
- You create a new file.txt in your working directory. Git doesnâ€™t know about it yet.
ðŸ‘‰ git status shows: Untracked files: file.txt

Tracked â†’ Modified :
- You add file.txt to Git with:
git add file.txt â†’ Now it's staged for commit.
git commit -m "Add file.txt" â†’ Now itâ€™s committed.
If you now edit it, it becomes modified.

Staged :
- After editing, you run git add file.txt again to stage changes for the next commit.
ðŸ‘‰ git status shows: Changes to be committed: modified: file.txt

Committed :
- You run git commit -m "Update file.txt" â†’ changes saved in local repo.

Deleted (working dir) :	
- You delete file.txt from your file system â†’ Git notices.
ðŸ‘‰ git status shows: deleted: file.txt


Staged Deletion	:
- Run git rm file.txt or git add -u to stage the deletion.
