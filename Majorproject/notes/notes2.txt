Hashing :

- For every input, there is a fixed output.
- They are one-way functions, we can't get input from output.
- For a different input, there is a different output but of same length.
- Small changes in input should bring large changes in output


Hashing functions : 

SHA256
MD5
CRC
bcrypt


Salting :
- Password salting is a technique to protect password stored in databases by adding a string 32 or more characters and then hashing them.
