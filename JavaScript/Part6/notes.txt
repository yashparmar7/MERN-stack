Function in JS :-
-Function is block of code.
-Function can be called multiple times.
-Function can be passed as argument to another function.

syntax :-
    function funcName(parameters) {
    //code to be executed
    }

calling :  funcName(parameters);


Functions with argument :-
-Function can take arguments.
-Arguments are passed to function when it is called.
-Arguments are used inside function to perform operations.

ex :-

function add(a,b) {
    return a+b;
    }

    console.log(add(5,6)); //output 11


Return Keyword : 
-Return keyword is used to return value from function.
-Return keyword can be used only once in a function.
-Return keyword can be used with or without arguments.
-Return keyword is used to terminate function execution.

syntax :
return value; //value can be any data type


Scope : 
- Scope determines the accessibility of variables,objects, and functions from different parts of the code.

1) Function Scope 
-Variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside the function.

2) Block Scope 
-Variables declared inside a block of code are not accessible outside the block.

3) Lexical Scope
-Variables declared in outer function are accessible in inner function.
-Variables declared in inner function are not accessible in outer function.sx

4) Global Scope
-Variables declared outside any function are accessible from anywhere in the code.

5) Local Scope
-Variables declared inside a function are accessible only inside that function.



Function Expressions :
-Function expressions are used to declare functions.
-Function expressions can be assigned to variables.
-Function expressions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

syntax :-
const variable = function(arg1, arg2) {
    //code to be executed
    }



Higher Order Functions :-
- Higher order functions are functions that can take one or more functions as arguments or return functions as output.


Higher Order Function (Return) :
- A higher order function that returns a function is called a higher order function that returns a function.



Methods :
- Actions that can be performed on an object.
- Methods are functions that belong to an object.
