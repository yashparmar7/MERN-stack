Console Use REPL :- Read Evalute Print Loop


What is Variable  ?
- A Variable is simply the name of a storage location.
- It is a container that holds a value.

ex :-
x = 5  # Here, 'x' is a variable that holds the value 5


Datatypes :-

primitive types :-

( nn ss bb u ):- key

1. Number 
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

Operations :-

1. addition ( + )
2. subtraction ( - )
3. multiplication ( * )
4. division ( / )
5. modulus ( % )
6. exponentiation ( ** ) // power operator
7. equality ( == )
8. inequality ( != )
9. greater than ( > )
10. less than ( < )

NaN in Js :-
NaN stands for Not a Number. It is a special value in JavaScript that represents an operation that cannot be performed on a number, such as dividing by zero.

1. paranthesis ()
2. Exponentiation ( ** )
3. Multiplication ( * ) and Division ( / ) or modulus ( % )
4. Addition ( + ) and Subtraction ( - )

Variable Declaration :-

1) let keyword :-
let variableName = value;

2) const keyword :- can't be changed
const variableName = value;

3) var keyword :- old syntax, same as let
var variableName = value;

Assignment Operators :-

1. = (assignment)
2. += (addition and assignment)
3. -= (subtraction and assignment)
4. *= (multiplication and assignment)
5. /= (division and assignment)
6. %= (modulus and assignment)
7. **= (exponentiation and assignment)

Unary Operators :-

1. ++ (increment)
2. -- (decrement)
3. + (unary plus)
4. - (unary minus)


Strings in Js :-
-String are text or sequence of characters

ex :-

let name = " tony stark ";
